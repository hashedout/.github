## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, We Are Hashedout Developments
We specialise in Magento 2 Development and Hosting. We help both Magento 2 Store owners directly, as well as other development Agencies, tackle their hard to solve problems. 

Whilst we do the standard system integrator tasks most direct clients need help with such as Installing Modules, Theme tweaks etc. We like to specialise in getting shit done, some of the stuff we like to get our hands dirty with are:
- **Magento 2 Performance Optimisation**, if a page is taking over 1000ms to load, its too slow! Let us help, we aim to get page renders down to sub 4/500ms where possible.
- **Magento 2 Security**, the amount of stores we see with zero Malware scanning implemented and even active Malware is insane! Fun Fact: Ecomscan can be run as a scheduled task for free! Even if it refuses to tell you what it found without a paid license.
- **Magento 2 DevOps**, Zero Downtime Deployments, Continuous Integration and Deployments are our Jam! Let us, help you, help your clients in being able to delivery quality changes without massive cost or pre scheduled releases.
